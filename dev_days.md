# [fit] Clojure and Clojurescript

---

# [fit] **__What is Clojure(script)?__**

---

# [fit]
- Functional Programming Language
- Designed for concurrency
- Modern Lisp
- Runs on the JVM
- Runs on the CLR
- Also compiles to Javascript[^1]

[^1]: What this presentation is mostly about!

---
# [fit] Not to be confused with:

- Closure - CS/Math concept
- Google Closure Compiler Project
- Clozure CL _(another Lisp implementation)_

# [fit] __Syntax Examples__

---

# Data Types

```clojure
;; Same as null in Java
nil

;; Numbers
1 1/2 2.7 1N 1M 0.666 ;; N = BigInt M = BigDecimal

;; Strings
"Dev Days 11!"
```

---

# Operators

```clojure
(= 1 1)
; => true

(not= 1 1)
; => false

(< 1 2)
; => true

(>= 3 4)
; => false

;; boolean or
(or (= 0 1) (= "yes" "no"))
; => false

;; boolean and
(and :free_wifi :hot_coffee)
; => :hot_coffee
```

---

# Functions

```clojure
;; Function call
(println "Hello world!")

;; Function definition
(defn square [x]
  (* x x))

;; Anonymous functions
(map (fn [x] (* x x)) (range 1 10))
; => (1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81)
```

---

# Flow control

```clojure
(if true
  "By Thor's hammer!"
  "By Aquaman's trident!")
; => "By Thor's hammer!"

(if false
  "By Thor's hammer!"
  "By Aquaman's trident!")
; => "By Aquaman's trident!"

(when true
  (println "Success!")
  "abra cadabra")
; => Success!
; => "abra cadabra"
```

---

# Data Structures

```clojure
;; Maps
{:first-name "Charlie"
 :last-name "McFishwich"}

;; Vectors - O(1) lookup
[1 2 3]

;; Lists (slower performance)
'(1 2 3 4)

```

---

# Binding a name

```clojure

(def failed-character-names
  ["Larry Potter" "Doreen the Explorer" "The Incredible Bulk"])

;; Constant
(defonce failed-character-names
  ["Larry Potter" "Doreen the Explorer" "The Incredible Bulk"])
(defonce failed-character-names
  ["Harry Potter" "Dora the Explorer" "The Incredible Hulk"])
; failed-character-names
; => ["Larry Potter" "Doreen the Explorer" "The Incredible Bulk"]


```

# Atom

- Manage shared state
- Synchronous
- Used to hold immutable data
- Free from race conditions
- Can be updated using the `swap!` function

---

# Reagent

- Clojurescript library that wraps Facebook's react.js
- Uses Clojure data structures to define HTML rather than JSX
- Allows you to define components as functions
- Takes care of calls to `shouldComponentUpdate`

---

# Re-frame

- Single `atom` used stores all state
- Register `subscriptions` to query data
- Write Reagent component functions to display data
- Write and register `event handler` functions to control and update state
